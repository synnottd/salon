# Salon Booking AI Voice Agent - System Design & Implementation Plan

"""
High-Level Architecture:

1. Voice Interface Layer
- Speech-to-text conversion using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe
- Natural Language Processing using DialogFlow or Rasa for intent recognition
- Text-to-speech for responses using Amazon Polly or Google Cloud TTS

2. Booking Management Layer
- Real-time availability checking system
- Staff/branch management
- Service catalog
- Appointment scheduling engine

3. Payment Processing Layer
- Secure payment gateway integration
- PCI compliance handling
- Payment confirmation system

4. Database Layer
- Customer profiles
- Appointment records
- Staff/service information
- Branch details

Core Components & Implementation Steps:

1. Voice Processing Module:
   - Implement continuous voice input stream
   - Convert speech to structured commands
   - Natural conversation flow management
   - Context maintenance during conversation

2. Appointment Engine:
   - Real-time slot availability checker
   - Conflict resolution
   - Multi-branch coordination
   - Staff availability management

3. Service Management:
